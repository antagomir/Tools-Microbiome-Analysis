## A list of R environment based tools for microbiome data exploration, statistical analysis and visualization  
  
As a beginner, the entire process from sample collection to analysis for sequencing data is a daunting task. More specifically, the downstream processing of raw reads is the most time consuming and mentally draining stage. It is vital to understand the basic concepts in microbial ecology and then to use various tools at disposal to address specific research questions. Thankfully, several young researchers supported by their experienced principal investigators/supervisors are working on creating various tools for analysis and interpretation of microbial community data. A major achievement of the scientific community is the open science initiative which has led to sharing of knowledge worldwide. For microbial community analysis, several tools have been created in R, a free to use (GNU General Public License) programming language(Team, 2000). The power of R lies in its ease of working with individuals lacking programming skills and easy sharing of analysis scripts codes and packages aiding reproducibility. In this post, numerous resources that can be helpful for analysis of microbiome data are listed. This list may not have all the packages as this tool development space is ever growing. Feel free to add those packages or links to web tutorials related to microbiome data. These are mostly for improving statistical analysis and visualization. These tools provide convenient options for data analysis and include several steps where the user has to make decisions. It can be tricky and frustrating in the beginning but patience and perseverance will be fruitful at the end (personal experience).
